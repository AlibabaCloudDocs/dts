# \[Notice\] Response parameters of DescribeSynchronizationJobStatus changed as of May 11, 2020

To improve user experience and provide more precise synchronization delay data, Alibaba Cloud has changed the response parameter Delay of the DescribeSynchronizationJobStatus operation to delayMills since May 11, 2020.

## Background information

In the current DescribeSynchronizationJobStatus operation, the response parameter Delay indicates the synchronization delay in seconds. To provide more precise synchronization delay data and ensure higher compatibility, DTS uses delayMills to indicate the synchronization delay in milliseconds.

## Effective date

May 11, 2020

## Description

-   Delay is no longer available in the response parameters of the DescribeSynchronizationJobStatus operation.
-   delayMills is added to the response parameters of the DescribeSynchronizationJobStatus operation.

## Impact

|Whether the return value of Delay is required|Impact|
|---------------------------------------------|------|
|No|None.|
|Yes|You must modify the logic of your code after May 11, 2020 to obtain the return value of delayMills.|
