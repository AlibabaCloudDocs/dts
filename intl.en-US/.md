|Action-level permissions on DTS instances can be granted to RAM users. This feature is applicable to scenarios such as precise access control.|[t1855826.md\#]()|
|February 2020|During data synchronization, [Data Management \(DMS\) Enterprise](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/57278.htm) can be used to perform online DDL schema changes. **Note:** If your data synchronization task was created before February 14, 2020, and has not been restarted on or after this date, you cannot use the preceding feature. In this case, you must stop and restart the data synchronization task before you can use the feature.

|[Change schemas without locking tables](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/98373.htm)|
|Data migration from Oracle databases \(versions 9i, 10g, 11g, 12c, 18c, and 19c\) is supported.|[t1843865.md\#]()|
|Data migration from PostgreSQL databases \(version 12\) is supported.|[t1849907.md\#]()|
|During data migration, a source or destination PolarDB for MySQL cluster can be switched across different zones in the same region. This operation does not interrupt the data migration task.|None|
|January 2020|Permissions on specific DTS instances can be granted to RAM users. A RAM user under an Alibaba Cloud account can access DTS instances that are owned by another Alibaba Cloud account by assuming an authorized RAM role. This allows you to have precise access control over specific DTS instances.|[t1855826.md\#]()|
