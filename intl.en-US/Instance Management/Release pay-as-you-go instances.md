# Release pay-as-you-go instances

This topic describes how to release pay-as-you-go instances in the Data Transmission Service \(DTS\) console.

## Precautions

-   The billing method of the instances that you want to release must be pay-as-you-go.

    **Note:** You cannot manually release a subscription instance. If you do not renew a subscription instance after it expires, the instance will be automatically released seven days later.

-   After an instance is released, its data cannot be recovered.

1.  Log on to the [DTS console](https://dts-intl.console.aliyun.com/).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Migration**, **Data Synchronization**, or **Change Tracking**.
3.  At the top of the page, select the region where your instances reside.
