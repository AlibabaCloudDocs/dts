# Limits

This topic describes the limits of Data Transmission Service \(DTS\).

## Data migration mode

The following sections list the limits relating to the data migration mode of DTS.

|Limits|Negative effect of failing to follow the limits|
|:-----|:----------------------------------------------|
|A single data migration task can migrate incremental data from only one database. To migrate incremental data from multiple databases, you must create a data migration task for each database.|You cannot create a single task in the DTS console to migrate incremental data from multiple databases.|
|The following data types are not supported: sql\_variant, hierarchyid, geometry, cursor, and rowversion.|-   Changes to values of the image, text, ntext, and xml data types are not written into the log. DTS can only ensure the values of these data types are consistent between the source and target databases.
-   If unsupported data types are used in the source database, this part of the data is not migrated. |
|Heap tables are not supported.|These tables cannot be migrated..|
|Tables that contain non-clustered indexes are not supported.|These tables cannot be migrated.|

|Limits|Negative effect of failing to follow the limits|

|The following data types are not supported: URI, UDT, BFile, and UROWID.|Data fails to be migrated.|

|The AIX all-in-one edition is not supported.|Â |
|Only the following data types are supported: -   SMALLINT, INTEGER, BITINT, DECIMAL, CHAR, VARCHAR, DECFLOAT, and DOUBLE REAL
-   GRAPHIC, VARGRAPHIC \(Data records of the GRAPHIC and VARGRAPHIC types are stored as double-byte strings. The boundary check and validity check are not performed.\), and DECFLOAT \(The data range is large. Some databases do not support this data type. Only numeric values can be truncated.\)

|Data fails to be migrated.|
|The primary/secondary switchover logic supports only the SYNC, NEARSYNC, and ASYNC synchronization modes. **Note:** In the ASYNC mode, if a forced switchover is performed when the primary and secondary databases are not synchronized, data loss may occur on the secondary database. A non-forced switchover is performed after the primary and secondary databases are synchronized.

|If SUPERASYNC is used for synchronization, DTS cannot ensure the continuity of the program during switchover.|

|You cannot migrate data from MongoDB databases in a cluster architecture. You must migrate each shard of a sharded cluster instance.|N/A|
|Transaction information is not retained.|When transactions are migrated to the destination database, they are converted into a single record.|

|Limits|Negative effect of failing to follow the limits|
|:-----|:----------------------------------------------|
|During incremental data migration, only the following DDL operations can be synchronized: -   ALTER TABLE and ALTER VIEW
-   CREATE FUNCTION, CREATE INDEX, CREATE PROCEDURE, CREATE TABLE, and CREATE VIEW
-   DROP INDEX and DROP TABLE
-   RENAME TABLE
-   TRUNCATE TABLE

|If you perform unsupported DDL operations on the source database, data fails to be migrated.|

|The database in DRDS instance are created based on ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instances \(MySQL 5.x\) that you purchased. DTS does not support databases that are created based on ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instances \(MySQL 8.0\) or ApsaraDB PolarDB for MySQL clusters.|The data migration task cannot be configured.|
|DDL operations cannot be synchronized.|Data fails to be migrated.|

|Limits|Negative effect of failing to follow the limits|

|During incremental data migration, only the following DDL operations can be synchronized: -   CREATE TABLE \(CREATE TABLE operations for creating partition tables or tables that contain functions cannot be synchronized.\)
-   ALTER TABLE

**Note:** ALTER TABLE operations only include ADD COLUMN, DROP COLUMN, and RENAME COLUMN.

-   CREATE INDEX, DROP TABLE, RENAME TABLE, and TRUNCATE TABLE
